# Who-is-in
### Deploying a Flask Machine Learning Application with Heroku

## Project Overview
I built a demo web page that a user can use to enter determine their chances of graduate school admission. The user inputs test scores and other metrics. The web page will then send the values off to the deployed XGBoost model, which will predict the probability of admittance. 

## Key Skills Demonstrated
* Supervised Learning
* Model deployment via Heroku
* APIs for web deployment
* Flask Web App
